# Jasmine - An AI Assistant for People with ABI and/or ADHD

Jasmine is an innovative AI project designed to assist individuals living with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Created by a developer who has experienced both conditions, this tool utilizes Google APIs to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. 

Due to the nature of these lifelong conditions, progress on Jasmine's development will be slow as the creator continues to learn how to live with ABI and ADHD. However, this does not detract from the project's potential to offer valuable assistance to those facing similar challenges.

Key features of Jasmine include:

1. **Email Summarization**: Jasmine can summarize long emails, making it easier for the user to quickly understand and process important information.
2. **Appointment Scheduling & Management**: This AI assistant helps schedule appointments by integrating with your Google Calendar, suggesting suitable time slots while also handling rescheduling in case of conflicts with existing events.
3. **Data Storage**: Jasmine creates a comprehensive database using the Google People API, allowing users to store essential data such as birthdays, relationships, interests, and other vital information that may otherwise be difficult to remember.
4. **Conversation Recording & Transcription**: To help individuals with short-term memory issues, Jasmine records conversations and transcribes them into text format for easy retrieval and reference.

Jasmine can also leverage paid services like Chat-GPT or run using local models through collaboration with Phidata (https://phydata.com). Phidata's community has played a crucial role in the development of this project, with special thanks to [@jacobweiss2305](https://github.com/jacobweiss2305) and [@ashpreetbedi](https://github.com/ashpreetbedi) for their contributions.

This README file provides an overview of Jasmine's purpose and capabilities as a helpful AI assistant for people with ABI and ADHD. Stay tuned for more updates on this project as progress continues at a slow but steady pace given the creator's ongoing challenges with these lifelong conditions.
